# PCA Project

This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

List of software and libraries required to run the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

2.Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd PCA
```

3.Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Gaius_Irakiza_PCA_Formative_1.ipynb
```

4.Open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

5.Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. It is located in the `root` directory and named `fuel_econ.csv`.

## Results

The results of the PCA analysis, including plots and explained variance ratios, will be displayed in the notebook as output cells. Make sure to follow the instructions in the notebook to interpret the results.
